# SteamUI-GoldenEra
A rebuilt from scratch version of **[SteamUI-OldGlory](https://github.com/Jonius7/SteamUI-OldGlory)** comes to **[Millennium](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium)**!

It contains many of the CSS tweaks and customisations that SteamUI-OldGlory has, including:

- Positioning of What's New
- Compact Home and Search to 2 rows
- Pre-2019 Style Game List (show more games!)
- Pre-2019 Style Gamepage Layout (swapping columns)
- Compact Friends Activity and News
- Compact Events
- Better Nav Bar
- Move Bottom Bar to Top

Note: **SteamUI-GoldenEra** is currently in beta and may be missing features that v1.0 will have.
